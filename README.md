## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a binary image classifier that detects human emotions—specifically **Happy** and **Sad**—from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images and learns to classify expressions into one of the two categories: `Happy` or `Sad`.

This system can be used for emotion-based human-computer interaction, mood tracking, or mental health monitoring applications.
