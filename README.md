## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is a binary image classifier that detects human emotionsâ€”specifically **Happy** and **Sad**â€”from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images and learns to classify expressions into one of the two categories: `Happy` or `Sad`.

This system can be used for emotion-based human-computer interaction, mood tracking, or mental health monitoring applications.

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two folders:
- `data/happy/`: Contains images of people with happy expressions.
- `data/sad/`: Contains images of people with sad expressions.

Each image is a face cropped to focus on emotional features. All images are resized to a fixed dimension before training.
